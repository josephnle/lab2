    <div class="body">
      <p>StudentHero is my newest project with my co-founder, Tam Pham. When completed, StudentHero will serve as a
        platform
        to connect high school students to summer internships and other summer programs. The idea for StudentHero was
        forged
        out of a realization that high school was already frustrating as it is without having the expectation of doing
        something productive over the summer.</p>

    <div class="body">
      <p>With over 150 registered members in the past year, UCSD Circle K is one of the largest student service
        organizations on the UCSD campus. Members rely greatly on the website, particularly the calendar, to find out
        what
        events are available. The organization also relies on members registering their event attendance to ensure that
        the
        logistics are in place for all members. This year, a whole new platform(both frontend and backend) was
        introduced,
        replacing a system that was in use for more than 4 years.</p>

      <p>SD Hacks aims to redefine Silicon Beach and establish San Diego as a major player in technological innovation.

        reliable
        website to handle registrations and to deliver information to attendees.</p>
